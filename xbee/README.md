# MicroPython on the XBee Cellular Module

The code in this directory is meant to be compiled for MicroPython and uploaded to the XBee Cellular Module itself.

# `main.py`

This is the main program that gets executed.  It is recommended to start here.

## `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`

These are not used by MicroPython nor the XBee module; but instead, they are used for setting up a local laptop for develpoment.  Such as `pip`, `pylint`, etc.
